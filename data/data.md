## Updated chemical component files

This directory contains all the chemical component definition (CCD) files that will change as part of the Backbone remediation project. 

These can be accessed [individually](ccds) or you may download the CCDs as a [compressed tar file](tars/all-ccds.tar.gz).

New peptide residues are regularly entering the PDB archive. Until the remediation date, we will update this repository to contain the full set of chemical components affected.
